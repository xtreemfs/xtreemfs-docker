# XtreemFS Docker

Dockerfiles to run the XtreemFS services in containers.

The the DIR, MRC, and OSD services are using a common image
named xtreemfs/xtreemfs-common. The containers are build from the XtreemFS Git
repository at https://github.com/xtreemfs/xtreemfs.git. After cloning the
repositoring by running

```
git clone https://github.com/xtreemfs/xtreemfs-docker.git
cd xtreemfs-docker
```

start with building the xtreemfs/xtreemfs-common through executing

```
docker build -t xtreemfs/xtreemfs-common xtreemfs-common/
```

Service configuration files are expected to be mapped into /xtreemfs_data. The
config files have to be named dirconfig.properties, mrcconfig.properties,
and osdconfig.properties. Example configuration files for each service are
provided in the config-examples directory. A new service can be startet for
instance by running

```
docker run -v /xtreemfs_data:/xtreemfs_data -p 32640:32640 -t -d xtreemfs/xtreemfs:latest osd
```

while the config is stored in /xtreemfs_data/osdconfig.properties on the host. Network
ports have to be mapped adequately while executing `docker run`. Default ports
are 32636 for the MRC, 32638 for the DIR, and 32640 for the OSD. You have to
ensure that services register with the correct address at the DIR service, this
can be achieved by setting the "hostname" parameter for the MRC and OSD service.

The provided client images contains the XtreemFS FUSE client and can be used to
build customized images for own services or run it interactively. The client
image is also based on the xtreemfs-common images and can be generated by
executing

```
docker build -t xtreemfs/xtreemfs-client xtreemfs-client/
```

You can run the XtreemFS client in an interactive container by executing

```
docker run -t -i --privileged --net=host xtreemfs/xtreemfs-client /bin/bash
```

Note that FUSE requires to run the container in the privileged mode.

Please consider the XtreemFS user guide at http://xtreemfs.org/userguide.php and the quick
start tutorial at http://xtreemfs.org/quickstart.php for a general introduction to XtreemFS.

## Using docker-compose

The easiest way to start up all the containers is with docker-compose.
```
dir:
  image: xtreemfs/xtreemfs-common
  net: "host"
  volumes:
    - "./config-examples:/xtreemfs_data"
  ports:
    - "30638:30638"
    - "32638:32638"
  command: dir

mrc:
  image: xtreemfs/xtreemfs-common
  net: "host"
  volumes:
    - "./config-examples:/xtreemfs_data"
  ports:
    - "30636:30636"
    - "32636:32636"
  command: mrc

osd:
  image: xtreemfs/xtreemfs-common
  net: "host"
  volumes:
    - "./config-examples:/xtreemfs_data"
  ports:
    - "30640:30640"
    - "32640:32640"
  command: osd
```
